• Did both weak and Galerkin formulation of the problem from the given strong form.
• Created linear finite element space to discretize the domain to find the stiffness matrix.
• Wrote code to implement the formulation and solving large matrix system.
• Compared with exact solution to find relative efficiency of the method.# 1D-Boundary-Value-Problem-using-FEM
